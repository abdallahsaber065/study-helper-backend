## Introduction
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so that they can be accessed and modified efficiently.

## Basic Data Structures

### Arrays
- Fixed size collection of elements
- Elements stored in contiguous memory locations
- O(1) access time by index

### Linked Lists
- Dynamic data structure
- Elements (nodes) contain data and pointer to next node
- O(n) access time, O(1) insertion/deletion at head

### Stacks
- LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle
- Operations: push, pop, peek, isEmpty
- Applications: function calls, expression evaluation

### Queues
- FIFO (First In, First Out) principle
- Operations: enqueue, dequeue, front, rear
- Applications: breadth-first search, scheduling

## Advanced Data Structures

### Trees
- Hierarchical data structure
- Binary trees, BST, AVL trees, heap
- Applications: searching, sorting, parsing

### Hash Tables
- Key-value data structure
- O(1) average case access time
- Hash function maps keys to indices

### Graphs
- Collection of vertices and edges
- Directed and undirected graphs
- Applications: networks, pathfinding, social media
